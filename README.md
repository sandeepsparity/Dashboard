## React App Visualization

# Dashboard


Good day. Nice to meet you. My name is Sandeep, and I think the entire software industry hires people incredibly poorly. You've probably been brought in to interview and had to write an algorithm or binary tree, from scratch, on a whiteboard. You don't get your keyboard, your google, your notes, anything -- and you're timed and it's stressful.

This is sub-optimal. And its only tangentially related to your eventual job of solving problems.

So. Instead here at my Project I'm going to ask you to take an existing project and add a feature to it; We do a lot of visualizations of real time data, so that's what I'm going to ask you to do. We use react, redux, redux-saga and material-ui, so I'm going to ask you to do that as well.

But you can take your time -- you can use the internet. You can learn about GraphQL if you have not used that before. It should take a couple of hours -- and I hope it is fun. And you will get an idea of what type of work you will do here.

Your mission, dear developer, is to create a working dashboard which visualizes the real time and historical values of a hypothetical set of equipment in the field. The equipment publishes its data every 1.3 seconds.

BTW: historical means "charting" the last 30 minutes of data, and realtime means displaying it prominently. (So one could scan the page and see the current value).

Using our starter kit code, you should be able to get up to speed quickly.

Live examples are linked in the drawer to the left.
